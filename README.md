# OpenWeightless-P
Protocol stack for the Weightless-P low power wide area network (LPWAN) Sub-1GHz license exempt radio protocol

This project aims to make available an open source implementation of the Weightless-P radio protocol stack.
Code from this project will be tested for to ensure it is compliant with the published standard.

Weightless-P is published as an 'Open Standard' 
Access to the specification is free to the IoT developer community on request
It can be download from https://try.weightless.org/Weightless_spec_form


ACCESS TO PATENTS:
The Weightless-P protocol is based on intellectual property that is the subject of patents.
Rights to use these patents are available to members of the Weightless SIG (Special Interest Group)
Should you wish to deploy this code or derivatives of it, you need to be a Weightless SIG member


ACCESS TO TRADE MARKS:
The "Weightless" & "OpenWeightless" are registered Trade Marks. The software license does NOT permit use these marks.

DERIVATIVE WORKS:
Branches and derivative works are permitted under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
Be aware however that derivative works are not permitted to use the Weightless or OpenWeightless trademarks without permission.
Be aware also that operating the Weightless-P radio protocol stack in any capacity is permitted while the developer / user is a signed up member of the Weightless SIG (Special Interest Group)  see:  http://www.weightless.org/membership/weightless-developer

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Contributions are welcomed, as are sample source code provided as a proof of concept / example. 
However, since the objective of this project is to output a radio protocol stack that must pass Weightless-P certification 
tests and can also be verified as secure using Formal Verification methods, it will not be possible to incorporate contributions
of source code. As such the project will follow the approach used by the SQLite project: "Open Source, not Open-Contribution"
