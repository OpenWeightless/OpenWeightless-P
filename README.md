# OpenWeightless-P
Protocol stack for the Weightless-P low power wide area network (LPWAN) Sub-1GHz license exempt radio protocol

This project aims to make available an open source implementation of the Weightless-P radio protocol stack.
Code from this project will be tested for to ensure it is compliant with the published standard.

Weightless-P is published as an 'Open Standard' 
Access to the specification is free to the IoT developer community on request
It can be download from https://try.weightless.org/Weightless_spec_form


ACCES TO PATENTS:
The Weightless-P protocol is based on intellectual property that is the subject of patents.
Rights to use these patents are available to members of the Weightless SIG (Special Interest Group)
Should you wish to deploy this code or derivatives of it, you need to be a Weightless SIG member

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Contributions are welcomed, as is sample code as a proof of concept. 

However, because this project has been established to output a protocol stack
that will pass Weightless-P certification tests and can also be verified as secure using Formal Verification methods, it will
not be possible to accept all contributions of source.

As such the project will follow the approach used by the SQLite project: Open Source, not Open-Contribution
